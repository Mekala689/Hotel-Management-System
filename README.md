# Hotel-Management-System
Overview
The Hostel Management System is a Java-based project designed to simplify and automate hostel administration. It replaces manual record-keeping methods with a digital solution that manages student registration, room allocation, fee management, and complaint handling efficiently.

This project is developed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and integrates with a database (MySQL via JDBC or file handling). It is suitable for academic learning, portfolio building, and placement preparation, as it demonstrates Java skills with practical application.

 Key Features

Student Management – Register and manage student records (name, roll number, room, contact).

Room Management – Track available/occupied rooms and allocate efficiently.

 Fee Management – Record payments, check pending dues, and generate reports.

 Complaint Box – Students can raise complaints digitally, wardens can track & resolve issues.

 Reports – Summarized view of room occupancy, fee status, and complaint records.

 OOP Concepts Implemented

Encapsulation – Data like student info and fees are stored securely using private variables with getters/setters.

Inheritance – A Person base class extended by Student and Warden.

Polymorphism – Method overloading (e.g., fee calculation) and overriding (e.g., customized display of details).

Abstraction – Abstract classes/interfaces define hostel service operations.
🛠 Tech Stack

Language: Java (Core Java, OOP concepts)

Database: MySQL with JDBC (or File Handling as alternative)

Optional: Java Swing/JavaFX for GUI


How It Works

1. Admin/Warden Login → Access system controls.


2. Student Registration → Add personal details, allocate room.


3. Room Allocation → Assign rooms based on availability.


4. Fee Management → Record payments, update dues.


5. Complaint Box → Students raise complaints, admin resolves them.


6. Reports → View hostel status at a glance.
